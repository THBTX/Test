# Warnings :warning: 
##### DISCLAIMER: We do not accept any responsibility for incorrect use of the autopilot, which may result in fiery reentry, mountain impacts or undesired entrance into PvP. Read and heed the warnings below!

##### :small_orange_diamond: Auto-Land - Use with supervision. Will only engage if brakes > mass. Uses brakes and hovers / vertical engines to lower you to a safe landing. 
##### :small_orange_diamond: Autopilot - Not suitable for trips less than 2SU. Ensure you have LOS (line of sight) to the target body before engaging as autopilot is direct flight and does not detect bodies (will fly into a planet / body if in between starting position and destination).
##### :small_orange_diamond: Autopilot to Saved Location - Accurate withing roughly 15m of saved and selected location assuming a brake landing is available. If Coast Landing is displayed, you will need to resume control upon arrival at your destination.
##### :small_orange_diamond: Auto-Rentry - Not suitable for bodies without atmosphere. Not suitable for bodies with high altitudes (Thades, etc.). Know the altitude of the surface before using. Alt+Space and/or Alt-C may be used to adjust hover altitude as needed.

# Installation

##### Pre-installation Notes:

##### :black_small_square: Button - If manually connected to the seat, will be pressed when you enter (sit), and open / extend when you exit (stand).
##### :black_small_square: Databank - Although not required, we recommend a databank be used.  This allows the HUD to save your user preferences and some long-term variables.  In addition, flight status is saved if you leave and return to the seat.
##### :black_small_square: Doors / Forcefields - If manually connected to the seat, will close / retract when you enter (sit), and open / extend when you exit (stand). Ensure they are closed / retracted before connecting to the seat.
##### :black_small_square: Fuel tanks - If _not_ manually connected provide a rough estimate of fuel levels. If manually connected, more accurate readings are provided and a non-HUD widget is updated.

## On the right side of this page, locate and click on "Releases" or select the "Release" listed as the latest.  Detailed installation instructions are located there.
